# CS-313-Projects

This projects foucus was to import a given organized txt file that was filled with Cars and their attribute

Next created a Hash Table to store the cars

Then write a Hash Function which assigned each Car a key

Collision was solved using 
  Binary Search Tree
  AVL Search Tree
  Linked List

Important Function is the Hash Function which causes Collision depending on if the programmer sets the % by a low number
the program will show the the status of collision with LinkedList

In the example where trees solved collision I was only able to use an inorder print method which showed the items which were stored
