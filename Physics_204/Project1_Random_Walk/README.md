# Physics_204_Project_Random_Walk

This project computes a random number between 0 and 1. 

If the number is between 0 and 1/4 the progrom will draw a dot 5 pixels down. 
If the number is between 1/4 and 1/2 the progrom will draw a dot 5 pixels up.
If the number is between 1/2 and 3/4 the progrom will draw a dot 5 pixels to the right.
If the number is between 3/4 and 1 the progrom will draw a dot 5 pixels to the left.

Random walks are a phenomenon in Physics more specifically in networks. 
Examples are electrons in the wires of a circuit, and photons escaping the sun.
